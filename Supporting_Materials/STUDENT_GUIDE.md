## Before You Start

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Python 3.10+ installed
- [ ] OpenAI API key (with credits)
- [ ] IDE or Jupyter environment ready
- [ ] Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes, async)

### Environment Setup
Run the environment checker to verify your setup:
```bash
python check_environment.py
```

### API Cost Estimates
| Lab | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| Lab 1 | $0.10 - $0.30 | Basic tool use, few iterations |
| Lab 2 | $0.20 - $0.50 | State graph with multiple nodes |
| Lab 3 | $0.30 - $0.75 | Multi-agent conversations |
| Lab 4 | $0.40 - $1.00 | Complex workflows, more tokens |
| **Total** | **$1.00 - $2.55** | Conservative estimate |

**Tips to minimize costs:**
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` for development/testing
- Switch to `gpt-4o` only for final runs
- Reuse cached results when possible

## Lab-by-Lab Walkthrough

### Lab 1: Building Your First Agent (LangChain)

**Goal**: Understand how agents use tools to accomplish tasks.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Tools**: Functions the agent can call (search, calculate, etc.)
- **ReAct Pattern**: Reason → Act → Observe loop
- **Prompts**: Instructions that guide agent behavior

**What You'll Build**: A research assistant that can search and summarize.

**Checkpoint Questions**:
1. What happens if the agent can't find an appropriate tool?
2. How does the agent decide which tool to use?
3. What's the role of the system prompt?

---

### Lab 2: State Machines with LangGraph

**Goal**: Build agents with controlled, predictable workflows.

**Key Concepts**:
- **State Graph**: Nodes (actions) connected by edges (transitions)
- **TypedDict State**: Structured data passed between nodes
- **Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on state

**What You'll Build**: A document analysis pipeline with branching logic.

**Checkpoint Questions**:
1. When would you use a cycle vs. a linear graph?
2. How do you prevent infinite loops?
3. What information should be stored in state?

---

### Lab 3: Multi-Agent Systems (AutoGen)

**Goal**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Agent Roles**: Specialized agents for different tasks
- **Group Chat**: Multi-agent conversation management
- **Handoffs**: Passing tasks between agents

**What You'll Build**: A team of agents (researcher, analyst, writer) working together.

**Checkpoint Questions**:
1. How do agents know when to speak?
2. What happens when agents disagree?
3. When is multi-agent better than a single agent?

---

### Lab 4: Production Patterns

**Goal**: Build robust, production-ready agent systems.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Checkpoints for human review
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and retries
- **State Persistence**: Resumable workflows

**What You'll Build**: A complete document processing system with approval gates.

**Checkpoint Questions**:
1. What decisions should always require human approval?
2. How do you handle API failures gracefully?
3. When should you checkpoint state?

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. "Agent keeps looping forever"
**Cause**: No termination condition or unclear goal.
**Solution**: Add max iterations, clear success criteria, and explicit END conditions.

```python path=null start=null
# Bad: No clear end
while True:
    result = agent.run(task)

# Good: Clear termination
for i in range(max_iterations):
    result = agent.run(task)
    if result.status == "complete":
        break
```

### 2. "Agent isn't using the right tool"
**Cause**: Tool descriptions are unclear.
**Solution**: Write detailed, specific tool descriptions.

```python path=null start=null
# Bad: Vague description
@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Search for information."""
    
# Good: Specific description
@tool  
def search_recent_news(query: str):
    """Search news articles from the last 7 days. 
    Use for current events, recent announcements, or breaking news.
    NOT for historical facts or general knowledge."""
```

### 3. "State isn't updating correctly"
**Cause**: Returning new dict instead of updating existing state.
**Solution**: Return only changed fields (LangGraph merges automatically).

```python path=null start=null
# Bad: Overwrites entire state
def my_node(state):
    return {"messages": state["messages"] + [new_msg]}

# Good: Uses reducer properly (if defined)
def my_node(state):
    return {"messages": [new_msg]}  # Will be appended if using add_messages
```

### 4. "API rate limit errors"
**Cause**: Too many rapid requests.
**Solution**: Add delays, use exponential backoff, or batch requests.

```python path=null start=null
import time
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential

@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60))
def call_api_with_retry(prompt):
    return llm.invoke(prompt)
```

### 5. "Agent output is inconsistent"
**Cause**: Temperature too high or prompt too vague.
**Solution**: Lower temperature for determinism, add output format instructions.

```python path=null start=null
# For consistent outputs
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# Add format instructions
prompt = """Analyze this document and respond in JSON:
{
    "summary": "...",
    "key_points": ["...", "..."],
    "sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral"
}"""
```

## Using the Utils Package

This workshop includes a `utils/` package that provides helpful abstractions:

```python path=null start=null
# Instead of manual setup each time
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "../..")

from utils import (
    load_environment,       # Load .env and validate keys
    get_langchain_llm,      # Get configured LLM for LangChain
    get_autogen_config,     # Get config for AutoGen
    OPENAI_MODELS,          # Available model names
)

# Load environment once
load_environment()

# Get an LLM
llm = get_langchain_llm("gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
```

See [Understanding Utils Package](Understanding_Utils_Package.md) for details.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic version working before adding complexity
2. **Print Everything**: Add logging to understand agent reasoning
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test each node/tool before combining
4. **Read Error Messages**: They often tell you exactly what's wrong
